# Assignment-Tracker-using-TypeScript
Introduction
Welcome to my first project with TypeScript! This simple web application is designed to help you track your assignments easily. As I embark on my journey to learn TypeScript, I've built this minimalistic website to get hands-on experience and explore the language's powerful features and concepts.
## Description

This project serves as an introduction to TypeScript, providing a learning experience to explore its features and concepts. The website allows users to track their assignments by adding new assignments with subject, name, given date, and due date. It also provides the functionality to delete assignments.
